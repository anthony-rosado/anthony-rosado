### Hi there 👋

I'm a back-end developer. I have knowledge of web development and relational datadases. Also I'm good at problem solving and team work. I have been 
programming for more than 4 years. I'm interested in improving my skills and learning how things work. In my free time I like to read articles or 
watch videos about programming in general and good practices of code.
